//! Network audio stream
/**
  * Audio streaming for a signal source that is connected via TCP/IP.
  * The network audio stream behaves like a client and receives samples
  * from a network audio stream server, CITANetAudioStreamingSearver.
  * 
  * The stream will always work within a streaming context and will never
  * block the streaming processing, because it is decoupled from the 
  * network connection and forwards samples from an internal ring buffer.
  * If the buffer runs out of samples, zeros will be return. If the buffer
  * overruns, the sample server will be suspendeb by blocking the network
  * data flow.
  *
  * Latency can be managed by either providing a small ring buffer or
  * oversizing the ring buffer and requesting a target latency.
  *
  * \note not thread-safe
