## ITADataSources

ITADataSources is a C++ library for component-oriented audio streaming providing basic modules to manipulate samples in a block-based audio processing.
In future it may be substituted by the new module-base [ITAStreaming](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/ita/ITAStreaming) project, but is still heavily used and therefore also updated.
ITADataSources is a component of [ITACoreLibs](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/ita/ITACoreLibs), a collection of C++ libraries for virtual acoustics.
